Simple chat application demonstrating Activities and Intents. 

Make an application which hosts a communication between two activities.
Both activities have an EditText and buttons used to pass the messages and a textview to display the conversation.
- Use styles to make your application presentable
- do not use raw values, all values(Strings, dimens) should be extracted
- use Glide library to display a "user icon" in both activities
- Lock the screen mode to portrait
